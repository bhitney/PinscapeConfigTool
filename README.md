# Pinscape Config Tool

This program lets you set up a KL25Z with the Pinscape Controller firmware and
select configuration options through a Windows GUI.  There are also some bonus
tools for accessing the device through the command line (via a CMD
box or Windows batch file), which can be helpful for setting up scripted actions
involving the Pinscape device.
